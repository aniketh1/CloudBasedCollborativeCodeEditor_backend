# Enhanced Socket Events & Collaboration Features - Implementation Summary

## âœ… Completed Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Socket Event Handlers

#### Room Access Validation
- **join-room**: Enhanced with user access validation using RoomMember.hasAccess()
- Added authentication checks before allowing users to join rooms
- Improved error handling with specific error codes
- Enhanced user tracking with room membership validation

#### Enhanced User Activity Tracking
- **typing-start**: Enhanced to include `userId`, `userName`, `filePath`, and `type: 'typing-start'`
- **typing-stop**: Enhanced to include `userId`, `userName`, `filePath`, and `type: 'typing-stop'`
- Added timestamp tracking for all typing events
- Improved broadcast format for better frontend integration

#### Real-time File Updates
- **code-operation**: Enhanced to include `userName` along with existing data
- Maintains operational transform for collaborative editing
- Tracks file editing users and last modified timestamps
- Broadcasts to room: `{ userId, userName, filePath, content, timestamp }`

#### New File Structure Events
- **file-updated**: New event for when files are saved
  - Broadcasts: `{ filePath, content, userId, userName, timestamp }`
  - Stores latest file content in database/cache
- **project-structure-updated**: New event for file/folder operations
  - Broadcasts: `{ fileTree, deletedFiles, userId, userName, operation, timestamp }`
  - Handles create, delete, rename, move operations
  - Updates room file structure dynamically

### 2. Database Schema Implementation

All required collections/tables are already implemented:

#### RoomMembers âœ…
```javascript
{
  roomId: String,
  userId: String, 
  role: String, // 'owner', 'member', 'viewer'
  joinedAt: Date,
  invitedBy: String
}
```

#### Invitations âœ…  
```javascript
{
  id: String,
  roomId: String,
  invitedBy: String,
  recipientEmail: String,
  recipientName: String,
  token: String,
  status: String, // 'pending', 'accepted', 'expired'
  createdAt: Date,
  expiresAt: Date
}
```

#### Users âœ…
```javascript
{
  email: String,
  username: String,
  firstName: String,
  lastName: String,
  profilePicture: String,
  isActive: Boolean,
  lastLogin: Date,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### 3. Email Service Integration âœ…

#### Fully Configured Services
- **Nodemailer + Gmail SMTP** - Primary implementation
- Support for multiple email services (SendGrid, AWS SES, Resend)
- Comprehensive email templates for invitations
- Email verification and connection testing

#### Environment Variables Configured
```env
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=aniketkorwa@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM="ColabDev <noreply@colabdev.com>"
FRONTEND_URL=https://cloud-based-collborative-code-editor.vercel.app
```

### 4. Room Management Updates âœ…

#### Enhanced Room Creation
- Room creator automatically set as owner in RoomMembers table
- Unique room codes/IDs generated using crypto
- Room metadata storage (name, description, created date)
- Proper participant management

#### Session Code Validation
- Validates session codes when users try to join
- Checks user permissions and valid invites
- Integrated with RoomMember.hasAccess() method

### 5. API Endpoints Implemented âœ…

#### Room Access Check
```http
GET /api/rooms/:roomId/access
Response: { hasAccess: true, role: 'owner' }
```

#### User Search  
```http
GET /api/users/search?q=john
Response: { 
  users: [
    { id: 'user1', name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com' }
  ]
}
```

#### Send Invite
```http
POST /api/invites/send
Response: { success: true, message: 'Invite sent successfully' }
```

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Files Created

### Environment Setup
- `.env.example` - Comprehensive environment variable template
- `ENV_SETUP.md` - Detailed setup instructions for all services
- `test-email.js` - Email configuration testing script

### Testing & Validation
